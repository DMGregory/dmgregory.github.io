  <h3>Abstract</h3>  

  <p>Methods for procedural generation of game levels frequently suffer from complex configuration, 
    often demanding technical expertise outside a typical game designer or level designer's skill set,
    and the risk of generating non-playable output that must be filtered out or post-processed to correct it.

    We present a "path-first" approach to level generation in the context of a 2D platformer game, designed
    to address these issues. Configuring the generator is a matter of tuning a character controller, something
    game designers already do. This controller is then used to generate simulated gameplay paths, which form the 
    scaffold for the level to be built. Because the level is generated from a feasible path, it gives
    strong guarantees of playability, and affords intuitive means for designer editing.

  <h3>1. Introduction</h3>

  <p>Procedural content generation for games (PCG) offers the tantalizing promise of extended replayability and novelty
    in games by creating never-before-seen gameplay content on demand, and of speeding and easing game content creation
    by sharing workload between content creators and the algorithm in a co-creative fashion.
    It is a form of generative art that grapples with the challenge of producing artifacts 
    that not only exhibit the visual or stylistic <em>form</em> of human-designed game content such as levels,
    but also support the <em>function</em> of play, affording player action and success. For a side-scrolling platformer
    game, this means it must be possible for a player to navigate their character from their spawn point in the level 
    to the goal or exit, using only the moves permitted by the game's physics model (eg. running and jumping).</p>

  <p>Models of possible player paths (or "play traces") representing such a journey through a level have 
     long been applied to address this challenge. Most prominent is the use of A* search to evaluate the playability
     of a game level, either...</p>      
  <ul>
    <li><strong>during generation</strong>, to accept or reject each new addition based on its playability or difficulty, 
      as estimated by the window of feasible paths it affords,</li>
      <li>or as a <strong>post-process</strong>, to correct a completed level, 
        adding potential paths where they are missing.</li>
  </ul>      
  <p>In these conventional uses, the level geometry is at least <em>tentatively</em> chosen first,
    <em>then</em> a path is sought to solve it. This limits the ways that information or design direction
    about play behaviour can influence the generation, requiring complex and often non-intuitive rules 
    and heuristics be used for the initial selection.
  </p>
  <p>Procedural content generation via machine learning (PCGML) approaches attempt to reduce the
    burden of authoring such rules by instead learning them from a corpus of human-made levels, but
    are not without their own problems. As is common in machine learning, the model trained this way 
    can be inscrutable, offering no guarantees that it will produce playable or desirable output
    in every scenario, and no clear route to controlling or modifying its behaviour other than
    re-training it. Available corpora of game levels to use in training also tend to be small, 
    limited to older games, and highly specific to the rules and play styles of those examples.
    A game creator seeking to generate content for a new game with its own distinct style faces
    the difficult prospect of finding ways to extend or blend existing corpora to fit, or else devoting
    a large volume of labour to building their own original training corpus unique to their game.
  </p>

  <p>In this paper, we attempt to address these issues by <strong>putting the play path first</strong>.
    Using the game's own physics model and character controller, which designers are already accustomed
    to tuning, we are able to simulate possible trajectories that a player character can follow. Coupled
    with intuitive parameters for the frequency of jumps, drops, and direction changes, we can generate
    plausible play traces with a controllable style and rhythm. Simple book-keeping helps us avoid
    creating contradictory and unplayable paths. With a path in hand, we can proceed to populate the level
    with tiles that support that path &mdash; solid floor where the player needs to stand or walk, 
    open air where they need to jump or fall &mdash; and embellish it with relevant details &mdash; 
    like coins and power-ups where the player can reach them, or enemies where the player can fight them.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Related Works</h3>
    
  <p>Compton and Mateas proposed the use of player jump trajectories in a platformer to estimate the difficulty of a particular
    platform placement &mdash; depending on how narrow or exacting the set of viable jumps from one platform to the next may be.
    This allows the use of a hill-climbing algorithm to vary platform placement in order to achieve a target difficulty.
    <dt-cite key="compton_procedural_2006"></dt-cite>
  </p>

  <p>The mixed initiative level editor Tanagra by Smith et al. demonstrated the power of using a player journey through
    a level as the backbone of a generative system, conceiving of gameplay as a series of gameplay "beats" of a single jump or 
    other action, which could then be afforded by algorithmically selecting and modifying a small building block of level geometry.
    <dt-cite key="smith_tanagra_2011"></dt-cite> The strict timeline approach has limitations, however &mdash; play in a Tanagra
    level can only proceed left to right, and it has no means to support branching paths since there is only one timeline.
    Teaching the tool new tricks also requires authoring complex constraint satisfaction rules that are unfamiliar to
    most game and level designers.
  </p>

  <p>Outside of academia, commercial games like <a>Cloudberry Kingdom</a> also employ similar techniques, tasking an AI
    player to play the level so far and accept or reject the latest block placement based on whether a feasible path can
    be found to reach it. The challenge is that the initial proposed placement must still be done according to quite complex heuristics. 
    In the words of developer Jordan Fisher, "There are hundreds of parameters buried in the depths of the algorithm...a seething, 
    chaotic pool of coupled variables. <strong>I no longer have any idea exactly how changes to them will manifest in the final product</strong>."
    <dt-cite key="may_10_how_2012"></dt-cite> Taming such a complex problem can take years of development.</p>

  <p>PCGML approaches can reduce the complexity of devising an tuning such heuristics by instead learning them from examples.
    While early attempts struggled with reproducing coherent and completable levels, Summerville and Mateas demonstrated that by
    annotating level examples with player path information &mdash; marking tiles the player character occupies at some frame
    during a playthrough &mdash; they could significantly improve the playability of the output <dt-cite key="summerville_super_2016"></dt-cite>. 
    They have demonstrated this can work with both AI-generated paths and those recorded from human gameplay,
    and varying the path output can offer a means to tune the style and personality of the resulting levels
    <dt-cite key="summerville_learning_2016"></dt-cite>. However, the sequential scanning model they employed faces similar
    challenges as Tanagra in that it bakes-in a left-to-right progression of play.</p>
    
   
   <p>More recently, Sorochan et al. have demonstrated the potential to generate human-like play paths for the game
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lode_Runner">Lode Runner</a> as their own artifact, 
    without initially committing to any level geometry at all, and following up by generating level content that supports 
    that path<dt-cite key="sorochan_generating_2021"></dt-cite>. The researches find that this helps to create more
    coherent levels, and speculate that this technique may support greater control over the generator output.</p>

  <p>TODO: incorporate citation for Tommy Tompson<dt-cite key="procjam_tommy_2016"></dt-cite></p>

  <p>In this paper, we use a similar concept as Sorochan et al., applied to the physics model of a 2D platformer, 
    and explore this promising potential. Our proposed method overcomes the limitations of previous works that
    were limited to single left-to-right traversal, supporting levels that include back-tracking or multiple solution
    paths. And we ensure that it is easy and intuitive to configure, without demanding a large training corpus.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Method</h3>

  <h4>3.1 Character Control Model</h4>

  <p>We begin with the physics model and character control logic of the target game. For a platformer,
    this will typically include parameters relating to the gravity, the character's speed, their 
    jump height, etc., which a game designer will tune in order to achieve their target game feel.
  </p>
  <p>Below, we present an interactive example of such a model. Play with the sliders to see
    how the settings change the shapes of the character's possible jump arcs, including...    
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong style="color: green;">running jump</strong>: jump while running right at max speed, holding right for the full duration.</li>
    <li><strong style="color: orange;">stalling jump</strong>: jump while running right at max speed, then release the button to slow in mid air.</li>    
    <li><strong style="color: red;">turnaround jump</strong>: jump while running right at max speed, then hold left to try to turn around in mid air.</li>
    <li><strong style="color: blue;">standing jump</strong>: jump while stationary, then hold right to accelerate in mid air.</li>
  </ul>

  <figure class="l-middle">

    <td colspan="2" style="text-align:center">
      <em>You can examine the logic used for this character controller in <a href="./platformer.js">platformer.js</a>.</em>
    </td>
  </tr></table>    
  </figure>

  <p>
    The character control model takes in a source state <strong>S</strong> representing the character's
    current position and momentum, and an input state <strong>I</strong> representing the controls currently
    pressed by the player. It then produces a new state <strong>S'</strong> that is the resulting state of
    the character after one game frame's worth of simulation.
  </p>
  <p>A strength of this approach is that the character controller is able to remain 
    a black box to the generator routine. Changing the game's underlying physics
    model or gameplay tuning will automatically adapt the generator's output to match, so
    designers can tune the generator using the tuning process they already use for 
    character physics.
  </p>
  <p>We augment the character state <strong>S</strong> with some counters tracking the number of frames
    spent consecutively on the ground or in the air. This is already used in many games to
    implement features like "coyote time" (a grace period where players may still jump even
    if they've run off the edge of a platform), and gives us tools to control the rhythm
    of the generated paths. We also add a "facing" property (again, used in games to select
    an appropriate idle sprite when coming to a stop after moving left or right) which helps
    the generated paths suggest an "intentional" flow, rather than excessive hesitation
    and backtracking.
  </p>

  <h4>3.2 Generating Paths</h4>

  <p>Paths are generated using a kind of Markov chain, where a given character state S is mapped
    to a probability distribution of possible input states I that the simulated player 
    could press next, according to designer-tunable parameters:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Time between jumps / drops</strong>: 
      a minimum and maximum bound on how long the player can stay on one platform, 
      helping to control the typical lengths of platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Jump probability</strong>: 
        how likely the simulated player will jump upon reaching the end of a platform,
        rather than walking off the edge and dropping down to a lower level.</li>
    <li><strong>Backtrack probability</strong>: 
        how likely the simulated player will change direction and travel right-to-left.</li>
    <li><strong>Height variance</strong>:
        how far will a typical jump rise above or fall below its starting height.</li>
  </ul>  
  <p>Beginning with a starting character state <strong>S</strong> on the left side of the map (stationary, facing right, at a random elevation),
    we select our next input state <strong>I</strong> using this probability distribution, and then run
    these through the character controller model to produce our new state <strong>S'</strong>, and repeat.
  </p>
  <p>When the new state is falling (velocity points downward), our generator can additionally decide whether 
    to intervene and transition back to a standing state, according to the timing and height variance parameters. 
    If so, it modifies the output state to simulate collision with the ground, snapping it to the tile 
    boundary above the hypothetical collided surface. It always does this if the player has fallen into the 
    bottom row of the map, to ensure the generated path never goes out of bounds by falling into a pit. 
    The top/left/right edges of the map are treated as solid obstacles, so that the character controller won't 
    take the play path out of bounds in those directions.    
  </p>
  <p>To avoid contradictions that lead to unplayable paths, the generator does some book-keeping as it goes.
    Any time a state requires that the player be on the ground, it marks the tile below them as "solid", to
    ensure later parts of the path don't attempt to pass through this space. It also marks the set of tiles
    that the player sprite occupies in any state along the way as "reserved". If a later step contemplates marking
    one of these "reserved" tiles as "solid", it can recognize that this space is already claimed as empty traversable 
    space, and allow the player to fall through it instead.
  </p>
  <p>This process is repeated until the path reaches all the way to the right side of the map.</p>
  <p>On occasion, the Markov chain can get stuck in a situation where there is no allowed input state for
    the current character state, or where it has meandered excessively without reaching the right side. 
    In these cases, the path is simply aborted and re-tried from scratch. Experimentally, setting a max of
    30 or so retries is sufficient to reach a successful path with high probability.
  </p>
  <p>Try playing with the parameters below, and observe how changing both the character control model 
    and the path tuning parameters changes the personality of the resulting paths to the end. 
    Click the map to re-generate with the same parameters.</p>

        </td>
      </tr></table>    
    </figure>    

    <p>At present, these path parameters are applied globally. But one could also vary these parameters
      over the course of a level, either following designer-painted "gameplay style regions", or direction 
      from a higher-level generator in the pipeline.
    </p>

  <h4>3.3 Skinning Paths</h4>

  <p>The final step is to turn these path annotations into fully-realized map tiles. 
    In the current model, we do this by iterating over the tiles of the book-keeping map laid 
    down by the preceding pass, and applying simple heuristics:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A tile that was marked as solid is filled in with a "dirt" tile.</li>
    <li>If this solid tile has no book-keeping annotations below it, we fill the entire column downward from that tile.</li>
    <li>If there's room to extend this platform one tile further to the left or right without interfering with any book-keeping notes,
      we do so with a designer-controllable probability. This helps reduce single-tile platforms and overly exacting jumps.</li>
    <li>If there's a sufficient gap of empty space above a solid tile, we can choose to place a power-up box in that position,
      again with a designer-controlled probability.
      (This can fill in for a dirt tile we would have otherwise placed to fill a solid reservation)</li>
    <li>Reservations near the peaks of jumps can be filled in with coins, with designer-controlled probability.</li>
    <li>Solid tiles away from the starting location, with enough free space above to stomp on them, can be places
      to station an enemy, with designer-controlled probability.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These heuristics are crude, but sufficient to demonstrate visually-plausible levels that maintain the 
    generated paths' playability guarantees. In future, we would like to investigate using a 2-dimensional Markov 
    chain as in Sorochan et al.'s work with Lode Runner<dt-cite key="sorochan_generating_2021"></dt-cite>, or a Wave Function Collapse-based generator to allow more nuanced and stylistic translation
    of the path annotations into level geometry, and to afford data-driven definitions of different platform styles
    to mix and match in a level.
  </p>

    a reader will be able to evaluate the feeling of playing these generated levels for themselves.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Limitations and Future Work</h3>

  <p>While Markov chain path generation gives an interesting variety to the levels, it can be hit and miss, 
    requiring lots of aimless repetition before reaching a success, and producing some very plain or very strange levels.
    In future, we would like to investigate using a more directed path search, possibly using a model trained
    on human input as in the work of Summerville et al.<dt-cite key="summerville_learning_2016"></dt-cite>, or a variant on A* for goal-seeking paths.
  </p>

  <p>The ability to generate a path toward a specific destination offers some exciting possibilities.
    In a mixed initiative context like the Tanagra level editor<dt-cite key="smith_tanagra_2011"></dt-cite>,
    a level designer could sketch a rough gesture for how the player should move through the space, and the generator 
    could respond by offering viable gameplay paths (and supporting geometry) that deliver on this direction. The designer could
    then erase some parts of the level and ask the algorithm to re-connect the separated parts, or create an
    alternate path between two already connected parts. A level designer may even be able to select and move 
    parts of the path level geometry, with the algorithm able to infer how the pathing and supporting geometry
    will need to change as a result. In this way, the path-first model could facilitate
    a very high-level and intuitive form of collaboration with the machine to speed creation.
  </p>

  <!--TODO: Illustrate example-->

  <p>These same concepts could also be used by a higher-level generator, laying down broad schemes for
    how the level graph should flow, according to a design pattern repertoire such as Compton and Mateas's 
    "Cell structures"<dt-cite key="compton_procedural_2006"></dt-cite>, then delegating to
    the path generator to realize this graph in actual gameplay.
  </p>
  
  <!--TODO: Illustrate example-->

  <p>There is also a great deal of room to explore ways of varying the style of the level generated,
    such as by moving between different "registers" of path parameters and skinning palettes, as suggested by
    Dormans <dt-cite key="dormans_adventures_2010"></dt-cite>. 
    Replacing the hard-coded heuristics of the current level skinning tool with a
    data-driven generator such as Wave Function Collapse could allow level designers to art direct levels or
    parts of levels just by providing a small example of the styles they want to use.
  </p>

  <!--TODO: Illustrate example-->

  <p>Lastly, we believe this approach to generation can have applications outside the context of 2D 
    side-scrolling platformer games. There's no reason that the character control model needs to be limited to
    running and jumping, and so games with more diverse palettes of actions could also find use for this 
    approach to procedural generation.

    abstract = {Techniques for procedural content generation via machine learning (PCGML) have been shown to be useful for generating novel game content. While used primarily for producing new content in the style of the game domain used for training, recent works have increasingly started to explore methods for discovering and generating content in novel domains via techniques such as level blending and domain transfer. In this paper, we build on these works and introduce a new PCGML approach for producing novel game content spanning multiple domains. We use a new affordance and path vocabulary to encode data from six different platformer games and train variational autoencoders on this data, enabling us to capture the latent level space spanning all the domains and generate new content with varying proportions of the different domains.},

    abstract = {PCG approaches are commonly categorised as constructive, generateand-test or search-based. Each of these approaches has its distinctive advantages and drawbacks. In this paper, we propose an approach to Content Generation (CG)– in particular level generation – that combines the advantages of constructive and search-based approaches thus providing a fast, ﬂexible and reliable way of generating diverse content of high quality. In our framework, CG is seen from a new perspective which differentiates between two main aspects of the gameplay experience, namely the order of the in-game interactions and the associated level design. The framework ﬁrst generates timelines following the search-based paradigm. Timelines are game-independent and they reﬂect the rhythmic feel of the levels. A progressive, constructive-based approach is then implemented to evaluate timelines by mapping them into level designs. The framework is applied for the generation of puzzles for the Cut the Rope game and the results in terms of performance, expressivity and controllability are characterised and discussed.},

    abstract = {The design process is often characterized by and realized through the iterative steps of evaluation and reﬁnement. When the process is based on a single creative domain such as visual art or audio production, designers primarily take inspiration from work within their domain and reﬁne it based on their own intuitions or feedback from an audience of experts from within the same domain. What happens, however, when the creative process involves more than one creative domain such as in a digital game? How should the different domains inﬂuence each other so that the ﬁnal outcome achieves a harmonized and fruitful communication across domains? How can a computational process orchestrate the various computational creators of the corresponding domains so that the ﬁnal game has the desired functional and aesthetic characteristics? To address these questions, this article identiﬁes game facet orchestration as the central challenge for AI-based game generation, discusses its dimensions and reviews research in automated game generation that has aimed to tackle it. In particular, we identify the different creative facets of games, we propose how orchestration can be facilitated in a top-down or bottom-up fashion, we review indicative preliminary examples of orchestration, and we conclude by discussing the open questions and challenges ahead.},

While there are many broad design principles, level design is inherently genre-speciﬁc due to the wide variety of rules and types of challenge found between genres. Determining genrespeciﬁc design principles requires an in-depth analysis of games within the genre. We present such an analysis for the 2D platformer genre, examining level components and structure with a view to better understanding their level design. We then use this analysis to present a model for platformer levels, speciﬁcally focusing on areas of challenge. Our framework provides a common vocabulary for these items and provides level designers with a method for thinking about elements of platformers and how to compose them to create interesting and challenging levels.},

The human designer can iteratively refine the level by placing and moving level geometry, as well as through directly manipulating the pacing of the level.
